## working with puppet bolt

# first we will have to establish ssh connection from the Puppet server to the targeted host.

1) On puppet server first create ssh key
$ ssh-keygen  ## accept all default and allow the keypair to be created.

2) # now on the targetted machine open the file located at, /etc/ssh/sshd_config. in the this file set the "PasswordAuthentication" value to "yes" 

3) # restart the SSHD service

$ sudo systemctl restart sshd

4) # now on the Puppet server run the command to copy ssh key to the targetted host to establish password less authentication over ssh.

$ ssh-copy-id <Internal-ip-address-of-tergetted-host>

# enter password at the authentication to connect over ssh.
# now test the ssh connection to heck if the ssh connection is set with passwordless authentication.

$ ssh 10.142.0.4

5) Now install puppet bold on the Puppetserver
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install puppet-bolt

6) now test the puppet bolt command to execute remote changes

$ mkdir project_bolt
$ cd project_bolt
$ bolt project init project_bolt

$ bolt command run 'pwd' --targets <target-server-ip-address>

$ cat script.sh | bolt command run - --targets <server-ip-address>

## if multiple target hosts are to be executed with command, comma seperate the host names

$ bolt command run 'pwd' --targets <host-1,host-2,host3,>

$ bolt command run 'pwd' --targets <server> --user <username> --password <Password123>

$ bolt command run 'pwd' --targets <server> --user <username> --password-prompt

$ bolt command run 'apt-get update' --targets <servers> --run-as <username> --sudo-password-prompt
