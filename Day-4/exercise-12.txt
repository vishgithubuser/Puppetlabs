## now that we have the Workstation installed let's start with creating the chef developement environment

$ chef generate repo chef-repo

$ cd chef-repo

## explore the folders and files inside this repsitory folder.
## cookbook folder holds all cookbooks
## data_bags folder holds all data bag files.

# move to cookbooks directory. 
$ cd cookbooks

# create a new cookbook

$ chef generate cookbook <cookbook_name>

## move inside the newly create cookbook folder

$ cd <cookbook_name>

$ cd recipes
## this folder has a default.rb file which the main file in recipes folder
## alternatively we can generate a recipe file as well.
#$ chef generate recipe

$ sudo nano default.rb

package 'apache2' do
  action [:install]
end

## validate the syntax with below command.

$ chef exec ruby -c .\default.rb

## add more resources to the file

service 'apache2' do
        action [:enable, :start]
end

file '/var/www/html/index.html' do
        content '<html> <h2>Hello, Welcome to the training session on Chef!</h2></html>'
end

# save the file and try applying the cookbook.

$ chef-client --local-mode --runlist "recipe[cookbook-name::recipe-name]"
